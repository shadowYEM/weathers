# weathers
This script retrieves current weather data and forecasts for a specific city using an API from [weatherapi.com](https://weatherapi.com).

The project contains 22 Arab countries, and you can add any country along with its respective cities to the `arab_countries` variable.


Note: You must change the API in line 7, specifically in the variable `api_key`.
